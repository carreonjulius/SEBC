Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?
	- The boot camp was very useful. Although, it took me some time to catch up and I wasn't able to finish the challenge and got stuck in the Kerberos setup. 

Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?
	- The least familiar topic to me was the setting up of the Kerberos. I really wanted to do it but I ran out of time here at the boot camp. The most familiar topic for me was the setting up of the Cloudera Manager and the CDH cluster.

Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?
	- I find all the activities helpful but unfortunately I wasn't able to finish the Kerberos setup.
	
How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
	- I think it might take me a week or two. I'd like to do practice more installations when I get back to the Philippines.
	
Thank you very much, Michael!
